# Betbright Assignment

The Python developer test consists of 3 questions. Please use Python 2.7 when completing the
questions.

1. **Date Calculation**
The Irish lottery draw takes place twice weekly on a Wednesday and a Saturday at 8pm. Write a
function that calculates and returns the next valid draw date based on an optional supplied date
time parameter. If no supplied date is provided, assume current date time

2. **Least recently used cache** 
Implement a least recently used (LRU) cache mechanism as a decorator and demonstrate it use in a small script. The LRU must be able to admit a ‘max_size’ parameter that by default has to be 100. Candidates are advised to consider how an LRU cache should work. One source of information
is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU

3. **Find the anagram**
Write a function that accepts a word (string) and a list of words (list or tuple of strings) and return
back a list with the valid anagrams for the word inside the given words list.

**NOTE**: Please provide the source code and unit tests for all the exercises ( Code can be
submitted via compressed attachment or online repository i.e. github, svn, etc).
Code should be as close to production ready as possible
